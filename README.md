# Anagrams

This is the starter code for the Anagrams workshop
UPDATE: This is a fully functional mobile application.

Anagram: A word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase. The word “secure” is an anagram of “rescue.”

The objective of this game is to create a new word by adding a extra letter of choice to a word shown on the screen. (i.e. Given the word "grandee", a user can create the word "enlarged" by adding the letter "l")
