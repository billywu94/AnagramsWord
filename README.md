# Anagrams
Anagram: A word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase. The word “secure” is an anagram of “rescue.”

The objective of this game is to create a new word by adding a letter of choice to the word shown on the screen. (i.e. Given the word "grandee", a user can create the word "enlarged" by adding the letter 'l'). Note: adding the letter 's' at the end of each word would not be valid.
